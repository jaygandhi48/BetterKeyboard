str1 ="Genetic algorithm is a well-known metaheuristic method to solve optimization problem mimic the natural process of cell reproduction. Having great advantages on solving optimization problem makes this method popular among researchers to improve the performance of simple Genetic Algorithm and apply it in many areas. However, Genetic Algorithm has its own weakness of less diversity which cause premature convergence where the potential answer trapped in its local optimum"

str2="In this paper, we show that the near field reflector problem is a nonlinear optimization problem. From the corresponding functional and constraint function, we derive the Monge-Ampere type equation for such a problem."

str3 = "For many researchers, Python is a first-class tool mainly because of its libraries for storing, manipulating, and gaining insight from data. Several resources exist for individual pieces of this data science stack, but only with the Python Data Science HandbookWorking scientists and data crunchers familiar with reading and writing Python code will find this comprehensive desk reference ideal for tackling day-to-day issues: manipulating, transforming, and cleaning data"
